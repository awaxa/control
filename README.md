### my r10k control repository

## requirements
- [Puppet Enterprise](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise)
- [r10k](https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k)

## notes
since r10k only deploys branches to environments, [tags](https://github.com/awaxa/control/releases) are being used like remote stashes and should not be considered releases
